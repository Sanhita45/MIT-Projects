An end-to-end solution for predicting heart attacks using Deep Learning and Flask web app.
\
\
\
Millions of people's lives are at risk of heart attack, particularly in developing and underdeveloped nations, due to a shortage of qualified medical professionals, experienced staff, and testing equipment. Hence, this is a highly important problem that needs to be treated quickly and accurately. Deep learning models are identified as powerful technique for complex datasets and provide more accuracy than traditional machine learning models.

*****************************************************************
Project steps given below:
-Collected Heart Attack Dataset from Kaggle.
-Generated Synthetic data using Deep Learning Library (CTGan)
-Data Preprocessing (Conditional Column, Valid Data Types, correlation matrix)
-Feature Selection by using Weka.
-Evaluated four Deep Learning models for heart attack prediction: KNN, ANN, SVM, and DNN
-User Input website for Heart Attack Prediction. 
-Deployment of Deep Learning Model on AWS

******************************************************
The initial dataset was obtained from the website Mendeley Data. 
 	Attributes 	Description 	Data Type 
1. 	Age 	Age 	Number 
2. 	Anemia 	Decrease of red blood cells (Hemoglobin) 	Boolean 
3. 	Creatinine_Phosphokinase 	Level of the CPK enzymes in the blood 	Number 
4. 	Diabetes 	If a person has diabetes 	Boolean 
5. 	Ejection_Fraction 	Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage) 	Number 
6. 	High Blood pressure 	If the patient has hypertension 	Boolean 
7. 	Platelets  	Platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL) 	Number 
8. 	Serum_creatinine 	Level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL) 	Number 
9. 	Serum_sodium 	Level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L) 	Number 
10. Sex 	Male/Female 	Binary 
11. Smoking 	If the patient smokes or not (boolean) 	Boolean 
12. Days 	Follow-up period (days) 	Numbers 
13. Heart -Attack event 	Had a heart attack or not 
 	Boolean 

*Data Pre-Processing: 
Data preprocessing is a crucial stage in the data analysis and data mining process. It indicates to removing null, integrating, and transforming data to make it suitable for analysis. Data preprocessing improves the data quality and makes it more convenient for the individual data mining task. (Jain, D.,2023).The selected data was clean and did not require cleaning; however, the dataset was not big enough to employ deep learning and conventional machine learning models. Synthetic data has been generated by using CTGan, (1,00,000) data records were generated. 

*Model Selection:
Below Deep Learning models and Traditional ML models were used:
1.SVM
2.KNN
3.ANN
4.DNN

*Feature selection techniques used:
1. Weka
2. FeatureWiz

*Data Visualisation
PowerBI

* Web FrameWork
Flask web Framework

*Cloud service:
AWS EC2 service for deployment
